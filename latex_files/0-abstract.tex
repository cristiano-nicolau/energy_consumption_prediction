\begin{abstract}
This project presents a comprehensive approach to building energy consumption prediction using machine learning and deep learning techniques on a specialized dataset derived from the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III competition. We transform the original dataset to focus exclusively on energy consumption variables, creating a targeted framework for energy usage forecasting across diverse building types. The study develops, optimizes, and evaluates multiple models to predict energy consumption patterns, with particular attention to the influence of temporal, meteorological, and building-specific features. Our methodology includes rigorous comparative analysis against established approaches in the field, identifying key performance differentiators and methodological innovations.
